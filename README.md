## Financial Modelling Consist Of different type of analysis :-
1. Ratio Analysis - Ratio analysis in financial modeling involves using key financial ratios to analyze a company's performance and financial health, helping to understand trends, compare to competitors, and inform forecasting assumptions. It's a crucial tool for assessing profitability, liquidity, solvency, and operational efficiency, providing insights into a company's financial position.
2. Regression analysis in financial modeling is a statistical technique used to understand and quantify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, allowing for predictions and future behavior forecasting. It helps determine how changes in independent variables (like GDP, interest rates, or market conditions) influence a dependent variable (like sales, stock prices, or company earnings).
3. Forecasting - In financial modeling, forecasting is the process of predicting a company's future financial performance based on historical data, market trends, and business strategies. It helps businesses estimate future revenue, expenses, cash flow, and profitability over a specific period.
4. Common size statement - A common-size financial statement displays items on each report as a percentage of a common base figure. Common-size financial statements make it easier to compare a company to its competitors and to identify significant changes in a company's financials.
5. Historical Financial Statement - In financial modeling, historical financial statements are the past financial reports of a company, like balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements, used to analyze past performance and build future projections.
6. DCF Method - In financial modeling, DCF stands for Discounted Cash Flow, a valuation method that determines a company's worth by forecasting its future cash flows and discounting them back to their present value. It's used to assess the value of an investment or business by considering the time value of money, where future cash flows are worth less than present cash flows.
7. Intrinsic Growth - In financial modeling, "intrinsic" refers to the underlying, inherent value of an asset, like a stock or company, as determined by fundamental analysis.
